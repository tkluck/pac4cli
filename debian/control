Description: Proxy-auto-discovery for command line applications
 On many corporate networks, applications need proxy-auto-discovery to know
 whether a certain URL is accessed either directly or through a web proxy.
 Browsers can typically handle this, but many command line applications (git,
 npm, apt, curl) rely on environment variable to hard-code a proxy regardless
 of the destination URL.
 .
 This little daemon enables these applications for auto-discovery by:
 .
 - setting the `http_proxy` variable (and friends) to http://localhost:3128
 - providing a simple proxy at that port that does proxy-auto-discovery and
   connects accordingly.
